# Display the visitor IP along with the HTTP status code from the Apache logfile

# Use cut to extract the IP address (first field) and status code (ninth field)
cut -d ' ' -f 1,9 apache-access.log | \
# Use sed to replace the space between IP and status code with a single space
sed 's/ /\t/'

# Explanation:
# - cut -d ' ' -f 1,9: Split each line by space and select the first and ninth fields
# - sed 's/ /\t/': Replace the space between IP and status code with a tab (or any other delimiter you prefer)
