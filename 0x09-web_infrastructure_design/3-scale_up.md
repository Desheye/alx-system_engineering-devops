Web Server vs Application Server
In this infrastructure setup, we'll distinguish between the roles of the web server and the application server. Here's a breakdown of each component:

Web Server
The web server's primary role is to handle HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and serve static content. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the application server. Here's why we add it:

Serving Static Content: Web servers like Nginx or Apache are efficient at serving static files such as HTML, CSS, and images. By offloading this task from the application server, we can improve performance and resource utilization.
SSL Termination: Web servers can handle SSL termination, decrypting HTTPS requests from clients and forwarding them to the application server as plain HTTP requests. This reduces the computational overhead on the application server.
Reverse Proxy: Web servers can act as reverse proxies, forwarding dynamic requests to the application server based on predefined rules and configurations. This allows for more flexible routing and load balancing strategies.
Application Server
The application server is responsible for executing the core logic of the web application, processing dynamic requests, and interacting with the database. Here's why we add it:

Executing Application Logic: The application server hosts the actual codebase of the web application, including business logic, API endpoints, and other application-specific functionalities. It handles dynamic content generation and processing user inputs.
Interacting with the Database: The application server communicates with the database to perform read and write operations, retrieve and store data, and maintain data consistency. It abstracts away the complexities of database interaction from the web server.
Scaling Independently: Separating the application logic from the web server allows us to scale each component independently based on demand. We can add more application servers to handle increased traffic without affecting the web server's performance.
Load Balancer (HAProxy)
The load balancer (HAProxy) distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve reliability, scalability, and performance. Here's why we add it:

High Availability: By distributing traffic across multiple servers, a load balancer helps prevent any single server from being overwhelmed by incoming requests. It improves fault tolerance and ensures uninterrupted service for users.
Scalability: Load balancers enable horizontal scaling by distributing traffic evenly among a cluster of servers. As the demand for the application grows, we can add more servers to the cluster and scale out resources accordingly.
Session Persistence: Load balancers can maintain session persistence, ensuring that subsequent requests from the same client are routed to the same server. This is crucial for maintaining user sessions and stateful application behavior.
Database
The database stores and manages application data, providing persistent storage for user-generated content, application state, and other relevant information. Here's why we add it:

Data Storage: The database is the central repository for storing structured data used by the web application. It ensures data integrity, consistency, and durability, allowing users to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.
Transaction Management: Databases support transactional operations, allowing multiple database operations to be grouped together as a single unit of work. This ensures data integrity and consistency, especially in complex business scenarios.
Scalability and Replication: Modern databases support horizontal scaling and replication, allowing us to distribute data across multiple servers for improved performance, fault tolerance, and redundancy. Replication ensures that data changes are propagated to multiple database instances, providing high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
By separating the web server, application server, and database into distinct components, we achieve a modular and scalable architecture that can handle varying workloads and ensure high availability and performance for our web application.
